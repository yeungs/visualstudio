# CHANGELOG for visualstudio

This file is used to list changes made in each version of visualstudion.

## 0.0.11:
The Visual Studio ISO already contain the AdminDeployment.xml file.
Therefore when 7-zip extracts the files from ISO into the cache folder
then this "cookbook_file" doesn't do anything if it "create_if_missing".
We won't be able to override any custom settings in AdminDeployment.xml

## 0.0.10:

* 19 May 2013 release of visualstudio
